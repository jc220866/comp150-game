Part (A) of COMP120 Assignment 1: Tinkering Graphics - Contracts
We have chosen four contracts to split between the four of us, but this does not exclude one another from asking each other for assistance, teamwork is gold after all.

Cyrus will be undertaking Contract #1 - Dungeon Tile Generator.
Adrian will be undertaking Contract #3 - Dungeon Entity Generator, unless he is unavailable or wishes to change contract.
Paul will be undertaking Contract #4 - Dungeon Entity Reskinning.
Jakob will be undertaking Contract #5 - Colour Blindness UI Analysis Tool.
